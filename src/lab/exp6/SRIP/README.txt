								Orifice Meter Experiment

Procedure to run the experiment:

1. Click on Start button to start the simulation.

2. Fill the Input form to perform the calculations.

Make sure the conditions below are satisfied while filling the Input form.
	a) Input form cannot be left empty.
	b) Input cannot be anything other than Numbers.
	c) Input cannot be Negative.
	c) Input cannot be zero. 
	d) Inputs for H, Da and Db cannot be more than 10000 cm.
	e) Input for Time cannot be more than 1000 seconds.

3. Click on Calculate button to perform the Calculations.

4. Outout is displayed on output form.

5. Click on Re-set button to re-start the simulation and perform the calculations with different input values.
