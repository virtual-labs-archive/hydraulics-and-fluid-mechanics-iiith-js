**Experiment Project Documentation**

**Introduction**

This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

**Project**

**Domain Name :** Computer Science &amp; Engineering

**Lab Name :**  Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics

**Experiment Name :** Reynolds Experiment

Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity which is used to determine the type of flow of a     fluid.More specifically,whether it is **laminar** , **transitional** or **turbulent**.

This experiment as the name suggests determines the reynolds number and the type of flow.

Building the simulator to simulate various flows of fluids and reynolds experiment as a whole is what the project is about.

This document helps to understand how the simulator has been built using primarily javascript.



**Purpose of the project**

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Reynolds** experiment simulation from **Java** to **Javascript**.

**Process Followed to convert the experiment**

1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

**Value Added by our Project**

1. It would be beneficial for engineering students
2. Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand how to build simulations with javascript.

**Risks and Challenges**

As I had not much idea about javascript learning and building everything from scratch was a challenge as well as fun at the same time.
